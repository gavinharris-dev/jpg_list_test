	<p class="text-lg mt-2">This is a simple application to allow a user to create a JPG.Store listing, and fully manage the 'splits'.</p>
	<p class="text-lg mt-2">Usage of this tool is likely a breach of the TOS with respect to JPG.Store and so you really should just head on over there to create your listing!</p>
	<p class="text-xl text-warning mt-4 border-warning-content border-4 p-6">Using this tool will likely render your Asset "locked up". Please think before Signing any transactions that are built!</p>
